<h3><em><strong>history.</strong></em></h3>
<p>
<em>
social distancing is a must.
we cant go to school.
it is dangerous.
headache.
lack of oxygen.
dry coughing.
snaazing.
you have to isolate your self.
it spreads fast.
(severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ).
The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads easily among people, and more continues to be discovered over time about how it spreads.       
So for the average new car sold in June of 2021 to cost $40,206 is -- frankly -- ridiculous. J.D. Power's June forecast showed the expected average transaction price will increase to the $40,000-plus figure, which will be a new record. The ATP is up by $1,667 from May of this year, the previous record by this measure.
